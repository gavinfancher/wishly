the ip address in the ntfy code is an internal vpn ip no nothing sensitive

eventually i would hide this behind a reverse proxy 

run 
```
docker compose up -d
```
this will pull the container and set a few configuration options. see this link [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/gavinfancher/wishly/blob/main/ntfy/docker-compose.yml)
